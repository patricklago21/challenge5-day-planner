# Challenge 5: Day Planner
## Completed by Patrick Lago

## Organize all of your daily tasks by the hour. Simply enter in a description of your task and hit the "save" incon. If your task is due that hour, the time block will turn red. You will see all of your upcoming tasks displayed in green. In case you accidentally close the window, don't worry, your tasks will still be there.
